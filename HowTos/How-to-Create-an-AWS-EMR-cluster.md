# How to Create a Spark Cluster on AWS EMR 

In this tutotrial you will learn how to create a AWS EMR (ElasticMapReduce) cluster and run a python spark job on it. 

You will learn: 

1. Create a Key Pair on EC2 

2. Create an AWS EMR cluster

3. Upload a PySpark program to S3 

4. Run a Spark job (Computation Steps)

5. Check out the results on S3 Storage. 

6. Login to Master Node and run spark on Command Line

7. Run pyspark code on Apache Zeppelin 



# AWS Console

![AWS Educate First Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiat/MET-CS777/master/HowTos/sceenshots/AWS-fig-1.png "AWS Educate First Page")

Click on the AWS console and open it. 

This is the main AWS console page.

## Start Up a EMR Cluster

# AWS EC2 

Amaozn AWS EC2 (Elastic Computing) 

The first step is to go to EC2 and create a key pair. 

![AWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiat/MET-CS777/master/HowTos/sceenshots/AWS-fig-3.png "AWS")

You can skip the following step if you have already generated a key pair. 

# How to Create your Key Pair on AWS EC2 

To connect to the cluster you will create later, you need a Key Pair as an identity.

1. Go to Amazon AWS website (aws.amazon.com).
2. Sign in with your user name and password. Go to EC2 (you can reach EC2 from the AWS services search text box).
3. Click "key pairs".
4. Click "Create Key Pair".
5. Pick a key pair name that is likely unique to you. Type it in, and click ``Create''.
6. This should create a ".pem" file that you can download. 
You will subsequently use this .pem file to connect securely to a machine over the internet. 




![AWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiat/MET-CS777/master/HowTos/sceenshots/AWS-fig-4.png "AWS")

Download and store the key file **.pem** file. 

It would make your commands simple if you store this key file in your HOME folder. 
HOME folder is the main user folder, for example on my Mac it is /Users/kiat/ (note that my account name on my Mac is kiat)

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)
<span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTE:**</span>
Never share your prive key .pem file with anyone (be carefull to not push it to github)


![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) <span style="color:blue">**NOTE:**</span>
You can click on the AWS log on top left to go back to main AWS console page. 

#  AWS EMR 

No go back to AWS EMR.

1. Select Spark here to have Apache Spark installed on your cluster machines. 
2. Select your keypair from the EC2 key pair 

![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)
<span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
It is important that you select your Pair Key. 
Otherwise you can not login to your master machine using SSH connection. 
</span>

You can also select the number of machines that you want to have or the type of machines. 

AWS makes here a suggestion of 1 master node and 2 worker node with EC instance type of **m5.xlarge** 

Each machine of type **m5.xlarge** (M5 General Purpose Extra Large)	

has 16.0 GiB	and 4 vCPUs	, 10 Gigabit	

Costs in N.Virigina data center approximaty $0.192 per Hour



You can check the pricing here 
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/ 

So this cluster will cust 3 * 0.192 = 0.576 

And because we are using EMR to make the spark installation more easier, amazon will charge more. 
It will be approximatly an addional 20% 

Approximate cost per hour =  0.576 Ã— 1.2  = 0.6912 USD 

AWS charges hourly, so it does not matter if you start and stop the cluster immadiatly you will pay the cost for 
a complete hour of computation. Also when you run a cluster for 65 min, you will be charged for 2 hours and not for 1 hour and 5 min.

It can take up to some minutes until your cluster of machines are provisioned, running and ready for use. 

The provisioning time depends on number of machines, type of machines and how busy is AWS in that time/date. 

![AWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiat/MET-CS777/master/HowTos/sceenshots/AWS-fig-9.png "AWS")

If you see that your machined have received their IP addresses, your cluster is ready for use.

# Back to Amazon EMR to run a Job on it. 

In EMR it is called a **A step** which is a processing step.
