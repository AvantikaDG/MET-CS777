# How to Create your Key Pair on AWS EC2 

To connect to the cluster you will create later, you need a Key Pair as an identity.

1. Go to Amazon AWS website (aws.amazon.com).
2. Sign in with your user name and password. Go to EC2 (you can reach EC2 from the AWS services search text box).
3. Click "key pairs".
4. Click "Create Key Pair".
5. Pick a key pair name that is likely unique to you. Type it in, and click ``Create''.
6. This should create a ".pem" file that you can download. 
You will subsequently use this .pem file to connect securely to a machine over the internet. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Never share your prive key .pem file with anyone (be carefull to not push it to github)
